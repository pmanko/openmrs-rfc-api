# Project title
- Start Date: YYYY/MM/DD
- RFC PR: https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-rfc-frontend/pull/1

## Decision, including impact on distributions
Example:
All distributions and modules should use the @open-mrs/auth module for authenticating requests to the backend REST API.

Example:
Each distribution can choose its own CSS libraries for the modules they maintain.

## Definition
Define terms here and explain what the "how does this apply to distributions" decision means.

## Reason for decision
- Bullet points that explain things.
- It's good to link to things, too, if there are relevant things.

## Alternatives
Explaining the alternatives gives nuance to the decision and shows we considered more than one option.

## Common practices (not enforced)
- A chance to give some comments on popular practices used for OpenMRS and its distributions.
- A chance to opine on some things related to this.
